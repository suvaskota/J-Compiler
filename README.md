# J-Compiler (CIS240 Individual Final Project) 

The purpose of this project is to create a compiler that will transform code 
written in J (a new stack-oriented language) into LC4 assembly code. This LC4
code will be created in a new file. 

In order to run this code, you need to download all these files onto a virtual machine 
and use the clang compiler within terminal
